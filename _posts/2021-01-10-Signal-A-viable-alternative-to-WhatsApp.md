By now, most of us must be aware of the updated WhatsApp [policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en) dated 04 Jan 2021. Credits to [Elon's tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153) for blowing it up. So, this piece is for you to know what the chatter is all about and decide whether you should catch this hype train.

First things first: If you are a person who believes in __"I don't really care. My life is an open book. Let them use my data. What can they do at the most?"__. Then read ahead to know how our data is ~~exploited~~ used.

## Back Story

In 2009, two former Yahoo! employees, Jan Koum and Brian Acton came together and created a new cross-platform messaging app called **WhatsApp**. By 2011, WhatsApp gained enough traction to be listed in top 20 of Apple USA's App Store. After some hefty investments from giants like Sequioa Capital, there was no stopping WhatsApp as it hit 200 million active users in Feb 2013. Such was the momentum that in later half of 2013, WhatsApp was peaking at 400 million active users.

All was going good, when in February of 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of WhatsApp for USD $19 billion. This reportedly caused many users to migrate over to competitors like Telegram. Wonder why? Because Facebook's reputation had been taking hits due to various security leaks over time [Report](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/). 

## But how did WhatsApp make money?

WhatsApp founders never wanted to monetize the app. They were pro-freeware, always put user's choices first and hence were against advertisements which according to them would ruin the user experience and app interface. So, to keep the app running they came up with a model of annual fee of $1 from the users. The fact that they had some good rounds of funding from ex Yahoo friends and Sequioa, took care of the 50 member team of WhatsApp. Also, as we know, users weren't even charged $1 in some countries. :)

## The acquisition aftermath

Call it Mark's far sight, Facebook saw huge revenue potential in WhatsApp and when the deal closed, they didn't waste much time in earning revenue. Launch of WhatsApp Business, Business API, WhatsApp payments have all been steps towards that direction. All this was in direct contrast to the ideology of WhatsApp founders and Brian Acton was reportedly quite concerned about the new moves. With facebook's new approach to user data, advertising and encryption, nothing seemed to resolve the differences. After details of Cambridge Analytica scandal became public in March, Brian Acton, on March 21 2018, tweeted 
>"It is time #deletefacebook". 
Jan Koum soon followed and just like that the duo came out of the jungle.

## Signal - A new player in the game

Brian made sure he stood for the right thing and announced $50 million to the Signal Foundation - The foundation behind the trending app 'Signal'. For those who don't know:

### Signal is a privacy-first, open source product of an independent non-profit org. It directly competes with the likes of WhatsApp, Telegram, FB Messenger etc.

## Present Conundrum

On 4 Jan 2021, after WhatsApp announced its new Privacy Policy, there has been great chaos in the userbase. 

> Starting 08 February 2021, it will start sharing information like phone numbers, location, transactional details, status, 'about' information, device information, IP addresses, metadata etc with Facebook. 

The reasoning given by them is: ensuring better security, fighting spams and enhancing User Experience. Te fact that the new policy is a blackmail of sorts, since if the users want to continue using WhatsApp, they **HAVE** to accept the policy or simply get kicked out. 

This has left a lot of users scratching heads. Looking for an alternative is tough since most of the friends and family are tied to WhatsApp and many of them simply wouldn't leave. For the logical ones, mind you, Signal has emerged as a **GREAT** alternative. With influential personalities like Musk, Edward Snowden tweeting about it, there has been a massive surge (top trending in many countries) in the downloads of Signal, so much that their servers couldn't keep up with the out scaling (everything good now :P). I say try it out, by now you may be surprised by how many contacts have shifted base.

With the picture made clear now (I hope), I leave you with a great infographic comparing some of these apps:
