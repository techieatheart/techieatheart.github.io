Hi, I am **Siddharth**. People call me 'Sid' (I know, clich√©). 

A DevOps engineer by profession, a full stack Python developer as a hobbyist and a FOSS enthusiast. I love all things tech and basketball. 

This space is intended for writing tech articles and documenting my thoughts. So, sit tight and enjoy the ride :-)
